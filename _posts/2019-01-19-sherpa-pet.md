As a pet parent who frequently travels with my furry friend, finding the perfect pet carrier has always been a top priority. After three years and over ten flights, I can confidently say that the Sherpa Pet Carrier has been a reliable and comfortable choice for both my dog and me. While it does have a few minor drawbacks, the pros far outweigh the cons, making it a fantastic option for anyone who needs a durable and convenient way to transport their pet.


### The Pros

**1. Long Shelf Life:**
One of the most impressive aspects of the Sherpa Pet Carrier is its durability. I’ve had mine for three years, and it’s withstood countless trips, car rides, and airport jaunts. The carrier has been on over ten flights, and it wasn’t until recently that I decided it was time for a replacement. The long shelf life is a testament to the quality of the materials and construction, which have held up remarkably well under frequent use.

**2. Comfort for Your Pet:**
Another major plus is the comfort it provides for your pet. The carrier comes with a soft, cozy mat that lines the bottom, ensuring your dog has a comfortable place to rest during travel. My dog always seems content inside the carrier, which gives me peace of mind knowing that he’s not just safe but also comfortable while we’re on the move.

**3. Perfect Fit for Cars and Flights:**
One of the biggest selling points of the Sherpa Pet Carrier is how well it fits in various settings. It’s the perfect size for car rides, fitting easily into the back seat or on the passenger side floor. But where it really shines is during air travel. The carrier fits perfectly under the seat on flights, making it a breeze to travel with your pet. Out of all the flights I’ve taken, I’ve only been turned down once, and that was during the pandemic in 2020 when there were an unusually high number of pets on board. Even then, I’m convinced it had more to do with the grumpy attendant than the carrier itself.

### The Cons

**1. No Wheels:**
While the Sherpa Pet Carrier has many positives, one area where it could improve is in mobility. The carrier doesn’t come with wheels, which means you’ll need to carry it by hand or over your shoulder. This isn’t a big deal for short trips, but if you’re navigating a large airport or going on a long walk, it can get heavy, especially with a medium-sized pet inside. After a while, the weight can become cumbersome, and you might find yourself wishing for a wheeled option.

### Final Thoughts

Overall, the Sherpa Pet Carrier has been a solid investment that’s made traveling with my dog so much easier. It’s durable, comfortable, and perfectly sized for both car rides and air travel. While the lack of wheels can be a downside during long treks through the airport, the pros—like its long shelf life, comfort, and compatibility with airline regulations—make it a great choice for any pet parent.

If you’re in the market for a reliable, high-quality pet carrier, I highly recommend giving the Sherpa Pet Carrier a try. It’s a travel essential that’s stood the test of time for me and my furry companion, and I’m sure it will do the same for you.
