Congratulations! You’re engaged, and that shiny ring on your finger is a constant reminder that you’re about to start one of the most exciting chapters of your life. But before you dive headfirst into wedding planning, take a deep breath. The journey can be both thrilling and overwhelming, and it’s easy to get caught up in the details. So, where do you start? Here’s a guide to help you navigate the early stages of wedding planning with confidence.

## 1. Create an Estimated Guest List
The number of guest directly impact your budget
Now that you’ve got the big picture in mind, it’s time to start thinking about your guest list. This step is crucial because your guest count will directly impact your budget, venue options, and overall wedding experience. Start by jotting down the names of everyone you’d like to invite, from immediate family and close friends to distant relatives and coworkers. Don’t stress about getting the exact number just yet—this is just an estimate. However, keep in mind that the more guests you invite, the higher your costs will be.

### Understand each others culture and traditions
This is also a great time to discuss each other’s cultures. Does he have a big or small family? Are there any must-invite guests you need to factor in? This is your opportunity to get a rough idea of who’s making the cut and how that will affect your overall planning.

### Vendors impacted by guest count
When creating a budget, make sure it’s realistic. Weddings are expensive, and denial is a river in Egypt. As of 2024, you can expect an average of $200 per person. Multiply that by your guest count to give you an estimate of the cost of your venue. This is assuming food is included in your venue; if you decide to cater, that cost will probably be split half for the venue, half for food. Other costs impacted by your guest count are flowers, invitations, and favors. Let’s break it down:

Sabrina and James are having a 200 guest wedding, including 5 bridesmaids and 5 groomsmen. They will need about 25 tables to hold 8 guest per table.

| **Item**                      | **Quantity**             | **Cost per Unit** | **Total Cost** |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------|------------------|----------------|
| Venue                          | 200 guests               | $200             | $40,000        |
| Bridesmaids Bouquet            | 5 bridesmaids            | $70              | $350           |
| Bridesmaids Hair + Makeup      | 5 bridesmaids            | $200             | $1,000         |
| Groomsmen Boutonniere          | 5 groomsmen              | $45              | $225           |
| Table Decor                    | 25 tables                | $100             | $2,500         |
| Invitations                    | 200 invitations          | $3               | $600           |
| Party Favors                   | 200 favors               | $20              | $4,000         |
| **Total**                      |                          |                  | **$48,675**    |


Now you should have a better idea of how many people will make the cut.

## 2. Set a Budget
Now it’s time to set a budget.
While budgeting may not be the most glamorous part of wedding planning, it’s one of the most crucial. Start by having an honest conversation with your partner about how much you’re both comfortable spending. Don’t forget to factor in any contributions from family members or other sources of funding.

### Include Your Must-Have Vendors
Beyond guest count, you’ll need to consider essential vendors. These services, unlike catering or venue fees, are less dependent on guest numbers and more influenced by the hours you’ll need them. Here’s a list of critical vendors, ranked from most expensive to least:

- Photographer
- Videographer
- DJ or band
- Hairstylist
- Makeup artist

Be sure to request quotes from multiple companies and choose the best fit for your needs.

### Dress, Tuxedo, and Accessories
Don’t forget to include your wedding attire in your budget. The cost of your wedding dress, shoes, accessories, and your fiancé’s tuxedo, tie, and shoes can quickly add up. Make sure these essentials are accounted for.

### Ceremony Location
Deciding where to hold your ceremony—whether at a church or a venue—can also impact your budget. Venues sometimes charge separately for ceremony and reception spaces, as each space comes with its own rate. A church ceremony isn’t always cheaper, either. If you’re not a member of the church, you may need to make a donation to use the space, and additional costs like an organist or choir, especially in a Catholic church, can add up. While the ceremony itself isn’t as expensive as the reception, it’s important to include it in your overall budget.

Let’s break it down with an example:

Sabrina and James have estimated they’ll need $48,675 for their reception and flowers based on their 200-guest count. They’ve decided their wedding will start at 5 p.m. and end at 12 a.m., a total of 7 hours.

| **Item**            | **Cost**  |
|---------------------|-----------|
| Wedding attire      | $5,000    |
| Ceremony            | $2,000    |
| Photographer        | $2,500    |
| Videographer        | $2,500    |
| DJ or Band          | $3,000    |
| Hairstylist         | $2,000    |
| Makeup Artist       | $800      |
| **Total Vendor Cost** | **$17,800** |


Grand Total Estimate: $66,475

This breakdown helps you see how quickly costs can add up and why it’s essential to plan and budget carefully.

## 3. Research and Tour Wedding Venues
Now for the fun part—finding your dream venue! Your venue will set the tone for your entire wedding day, so take your time with this step. Don’t rush! Start early! Start early! Basking in the moment is great, but don’t wait too long. Venue dates fill up quickly, and you also want to give yourself time to make payments on the venue. For example, if you book a venue 12 months out, you will have 12 months to make monthly payments.

Start by researching venues in your area that align with your vision and budget. Consider factors such as parking, capacity, style, and amenities. Do you want an indoor or outdoor wedding? Are you dreaming of a historic mansion, a modern loft, or a beachside ceremony? Narrow down your options and make a list of venues you’d like to tour.

When touring venues, keep these questions in mind:

- **Capacity**: Does the venue comfortably accommodate your estimated guest count?
- **Availability**: Is the venue available on your desired wedding date? If not, are you flexible with your date?
- **Style**: Does the venue’s aesthetic match the vibe you’re going for? Will it require a lot of additional décor to achieve your vision?
- **Cost**: What is the venue’s rental fee, and what’s included? Are there any additional costs for things like tables, chairs, or linens?
- **Logistics**: Is the venue easily accessible for your guests? Are there nearby accommodations if needed? What’s the parking situation?
- **Weather**: If you’re planning an outdoor wedding, what’s the backup plan in case of bad weather?
- **Catering and Vendors**: Does the venue have in-house catering, or can you bring in your own vendors? Are there any restrictions or preferred vendor lists you need to be aware of?
- **Hours**: What is the latest time your reception can end?

Remember, your venue will play a huge role in shaping the look and feel of your wedding day, so choose a place that feels like “you.” Whether it’s a rustic barn, an elegant ballroom, or a trendy rooftop, make sure it aligns with your vision and makes you feel excited about saying “I do.”

## 4. Relax and Enjoy the Process
Last but not least, don’t forget to enjoy the process. Wedding planning can be stressful at times, but it’s also a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Take breaks when you need to, lean on your partner and loved ones for support, and remember that the most important thing is marrying the love of your life.

So, go ahead and pop that champagne, because you’re engaged, and the best is yet to come. Happy planning!
