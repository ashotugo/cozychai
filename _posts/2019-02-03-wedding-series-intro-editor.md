I know how magical (and, let’s be real, how stressful) planning a wedding can be. There are so many details to consider, from picking the perfect dress to choosing a venue that fits your vibe. And then there’s the guest list, the budget, the flowers—oh, the list goes on! It can all feel a bit overwhelming, but that’s where CozyChai comes in. I’m here to help you navigate the journey with a bit more ease and a lot more joy.

### Why This Series?

Wedding planning is a journey, and like any journey, it’s one that’s better with a little guidance and a lot of love.
